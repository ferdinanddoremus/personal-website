# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a personal website built with **Waku** (a React Server Components framework) and **TailwindCSS**. The site features a blog/writings section that processes markdown files from the `private/content/writings/` directory.

## Key Technologies

- **Waku**: React Server Components framework for static site generation
- **React 19**: Using React Server Components
- **TailwindCSS v4**: For styling (configured via Vite plugin)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript configuration
- **remark/gray-matter**: Markdown processing for blog posts

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm run start
```

## Architecture Overview

### Page Routing
- Uses Waku's file-based routing with type-safe generated routes in `src/pages.gen.ts`
- Static pages: `/`, `/about`, `/writings`
- Dynamic pages: `/writings/[slug]` for individual blog posts
- All pages use static generation (`render: 'static'`)

### Content Management
- Blog posts are markdown files stored in `private/content/writings/`
- Posts use frontmatter for metadata (title, date, excerpt)
- The `src/lib/markdown.ts` module handles:
  - Reading and parsing markdown files with gray-matter
  - Converting markdown to HTML with remark
  - Generating static paths for dynamic routes

### Component Structure
- `src/pages/_layout.tsx`: Root layout with Header/Footer
- `src/components/`: Reusable components (header, footer, counter)
- Styling is primarily inline styles with some global CSS in `src/styles.css`

### File Organization
```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable React components
├── lib/           # Utility functions (markdown processing)
├── pages/         # Route components and layouts
└── pages.gen.ts   # Auto-generated route types (do not edit manually)

private/content/writings/  # Markdown blog posts
```

## Important Notes

- The `src/pages.gen.ts` file is auto-generated by Waku - do not edit manually
- Blog posts must be placed in `private/content/writings/` as `.md` files
- All pages use static generation, making this a fully static site
- TailwindCSS is configured via the Vite plugin in `waku.config.ts`
